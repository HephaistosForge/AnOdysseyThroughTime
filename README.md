# An Odyssey Through Time

A game created for the MV Christmas Gamejam 2022.

You are aboard a small Viking longship, caught in a fierce storm at sea.
As you struggle to navigate through the raging thunderstorm, you notice maelstroms forming on the waterâ€™s surface, threatening to drag you to the ocean floor.
The storm intensifies, and a lightning bolt strikes the ship's main mast. Suddenly, you find yourself aboard a different vessel in another era, still in these treacherous waters, having been pulled through a time vortex.

Can you reach the safety of the island this time before another storm arises?
